# Coursera Capstone Project

Hi! My name is Alexis Raymond and I am a Management Information Systems and Analytics student at the Telfer School of Management of the University of Ottawa.

Data science is a field that has always interested me as it combines the two fields I am most interested in: technology and business. In fact, I believe that having the ability to leverage analytics to make data-driven decisions is invaluable in today's business context.

That is why I embarked in the journey of completing the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) on Coursera. Among other things, while pursuing this certificate I have learnt the data science methodology and how to use Python to perform data analysis, data visualizations and machine learning.

To receive this certification, students are asked to complete a capstone project on the topic of their choice. I chose to use my new knowledge to understand the factors that make a Starbucks location successful. Please read my report and go through my Jupyter notebooks to see my findings.
